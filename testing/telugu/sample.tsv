8000	10000	Mother's Talk
11000	16000	In a village, a Brahmin used to live with his mother.
17000	21000	One day, a Brahmin had to go to another village.
21000	23000	He used to be a Brahmin.
24000	25000	Then his mother used to say,
26000	28000	Why do you go alone?
29000	31000	You can take anyone with you.
32000	33000	Then the Brahmin used to say,
34000	37000	True, I have to go in the way of asking.
38000	41000	But in that question, there are no diseases.
42000	44000	He says there are no thieves.
45000	48000	But it would be nice if anyone comes with you.
49000	50000	Mother, don't be afraid.
51000	56000	I will go alone and come back home tomorrow evening.
57000	61000	But the mother doesn't like to go alone.
62000	65000	With this, she goes to the garden near the house.
66000	68000	She takes a stone from the garden.
69000	72000	I don't agree to go alone.
74000	77000	She says, Take this stone and keep it with you.
78000	81000	She takes the stone to make her mother happy.
82000	83000	She puts it in her bag.
84000	87000	After that, she takes the stone and starts her journey.
88000	90000	That is the first time.
91000	93000	That Brahmin can't touch the end.
94000	96000	Then he sees a big stone.
97000	100000	He thinks that he will take the stone along with him.
101000	104000	The Brahmin eats his food and takes the stone.
104000	105000	He takes the stone along with him.
106000	109000	The Brahmin gets up in the middle of the night.
110000	113000	In the same stone, there is a snake.
114000	118000	The snake that comes out of the stone looks at the snake near the Brahmin.
119000	121000	The snake immediately comes near the snake.
122000	123000	It eats the food in the snake.
124000	126000	The snake looks at it and gets angry.
127000	129000	It immediately hunts the snake.
130000	131000	It kills the snake.
131000	134000	After killing the snake, the Brahmin gets up.
135000	137000	He immediately looks at the snake.
138000	140000	There, he notices that the snake is dead near the snake.
141000	144000	He thinks that the snake saved his life from the snake.
145000	149000	He turns the snake into a snake.
150000	153000	He thinks that he should listen to the mother's words carefully.
154000	157000	He should listen to the elders' words carefully.
