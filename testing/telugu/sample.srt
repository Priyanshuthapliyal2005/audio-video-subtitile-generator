Mother's Talk

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In a village, a Brahmin used to live with his mother.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One day, a Brahmin had to go to another village.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He used to be a Brahmin.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then his mother used to say,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why do you go alone?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can take anyone with you.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then the Brahmin used to say,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
True, I have to go in the way of asking.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But in that question, there are no diseases.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He says there are no thieves.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it would be nice if anyone comes with you.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Mother, don't be afraid.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will go alone and come back home tomorrow evening.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But the mother doesn't like to go alone.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
With this, she goes to the garden near the house.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She takes a stone from the garden.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't agree to go alone.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She says, Take this stone and keep it with you.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She takes the stone to make her mother happy.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She puts it in her bag.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After that, she takes the stone and starts her journey.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That is the first time.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That Brahmin can't touch the end.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then he sees a big stone.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He thinks that he will take the stone along with him.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Brahmin eats his food and takes the stone.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He takes the stone along with him.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Brahmin gets up in the middle of the night.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In the same stone, there is a snake.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The snake that comes out of the stone looks at the snake near the Brahmin.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The snake immediately comes near the snake.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It eats the food in the snake.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The snake looks at it and gets angry.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It immediately hunts the snake.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It kills the snake.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After killing the snake, the Brahmin gets up.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He immediately looks at the snake.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There, he notices that the snake is dead near the snake.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He thinks that the snake saved his life from the snake.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He turns the snake into a snake.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He thinks that he should listen to the mother's words carefully.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He should listen to the elders' words carefully.
