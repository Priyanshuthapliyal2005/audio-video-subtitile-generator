Mother's Talk

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
In a village, a Brahmin used to live with his mother.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
One day, a Brahmin had to go to another village.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
He used to be a Brahmin.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Then his mother used to say,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Why do you go alone?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You can take anyone with you.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Then the Brahmin used to say,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
True, I have to go in the way of asking.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
But in that question, there are no diseases.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
He says there are no thieves.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
But it would be nice if anyone comes with you.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Mother, don't be afraid.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
I will go alone and come back home tomorrow evening.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
But the mother doesn't like to go alone.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
With this, she goes to the garden near the house.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
She takes a stone from the garden.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't agree to go alone.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
She says, Take this stone and keep it with you.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
She takes the stone to make her mother happy.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
She puts it in her bag.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
After that, she takes the stone and starts her journey.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
That is the first time.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
That Brahmin can't touch the end.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Then he sees a big stone.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
He thinks that he will take the stone along with him.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
The Brahmin eats his food and takes the stone.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
He takes the stone along with him.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
The Brahmin gets up in the middle of the night.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
In the same stone, there is a snake.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
The snake that comes out of the stone looks at the snake near the Brahmin.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
The snake immediately comes near the snake.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It eats the food in the snake.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
The snake looks at it and gets angry.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
It immediately hunts the snake.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
It kills the snake.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
After killing the snake, the Brahmin gets up.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
He immediately looks at the snake.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
There, he notices that the snake is dead near the snake.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
He thinks that the snake saved his life from the snake.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
He turns the snake into a snake.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
He thinks that he should listen to the mother's words carefully.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
He should listen to the elders' words carefully.
