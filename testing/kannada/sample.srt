1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Archery, for the sake of theましょう,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,640
was very beautiful.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,520
He would move in a huge bowl and a bed was sown,

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,840
busy serving food for him.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,760
He stood aside,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,560
forbidding food from being dogs and crying.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,560
He could see cash and wore his hat if he felt it.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,940
When he saw the cashier at a shop physically,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,700
he would say,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,540
Please look very beautiful,

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,540
Did you ask me to sing a song?

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,540
I know that you are very happy.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,540
She was very happy to sing.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,540
When she sang, she was very scared.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,540
That is why she was scared of roti.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,540
She was scared of roti.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,540
She ate and ran away.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,540
She was very scared of roti.
