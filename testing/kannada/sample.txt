Archery, for the sake of theましょう,
was very beautiful.
He would move in a huge bowl and a bed was sown,
busy serving food for him.
He stood aside,
forbidding food from being dogs and crying.
He could see cash and wore his hat if he felt it.
When he saw the cashier at a shop physically,
he would say,
Please look very beautiful,
Did you ask me to sing a song?
I know that you are very happy.
She was very happy to sing.
When she sang, she was very scared.
That is why she was scared of roti.
She was scared of roti.
She ate and ran away.
She was very scared of roti.
