00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
In a very big tree in the field, it was very green.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
It was also covered with leaves.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
One day, a child was going to that field.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
It was also very hot.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
He saw that there was a very big tree in front of it.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And there were leaves on that tree.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
After seeing the leaves, water came into his mouth.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
He thought that he should rest a little after his stomach.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
He slept for a while in the shade of the tree.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
After a while, he woke up and left.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The next day, he was standing there and laughing.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
He saw that tree.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
He said that there is not a single tree in the tree.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
He asked, where did all the leaves go?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
The tree said that all the leaves were eaten.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
But if you give him water, then I will give you a lot of leaves.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
That tree was given water every day.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
After a few days, the tree was given fruit.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
After seeing the fruit, he was very happy.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
We get this story so easily.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
That we should give water to the tree plants.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
In return, we give good weather, fruit and vegetables to the tree.
