0	11000	In a very big tree in the field, it was very green.
11000	14000	It was also covered with leaves.
14000	18000	One day, a child was going to that field.
18000	21000	It was also very hot.
21000	25000	He saw that there was a very big tree in front of it.
25000	29000	And there were leaves on that tree.
29000	33000	After seeing the leaves, water came into his mouth.
33000	39000	He thought that he should rest a little after his stomach.
39000	44000	He slept for a while in the shade of the tree.
44000	49000	After a while, he woke up and left.
49000	53000	The next day, he was standing there and laughing.
53000	56000	He saw that tree.
56000	59000	He said that there is not a single tree in the tree.
59000	63000	He asked, where did all the leaves go?
63000	67000	The tree said that all the leaves were eaten.
67000	73000	But if you give him water, then I will give you a lot of leaves.
73000	78000	That tree was given water every day.
78000	83000	After a few days, the tree was given fruit.
83000	88000	After seeing the fruit, he was very happy.
88000	92000	We get this story so easily.
92000	95000	That we should give water to the tree plants.
95000	101000	In return, we give good weather, fruit and vegetables to the tree.
