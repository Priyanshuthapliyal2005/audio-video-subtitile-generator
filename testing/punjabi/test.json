He saw that there was a very big tree in front of it. And there were leaves on that tree. After seeing the leaves, water came into his mouth. He thought that he should rest a little after his stomach. He slept for a while in the shade of the tree. After a while, he woke up and left. The next day, he was standing there and laughing. He saw that tree. He said that there is not a single tree in the tree. He asked, where did all the leaves go? The tree said that all the leaves were eaten. But if you give him water, then I will give you a lot of leaves. That tree was given water every day. After a few days, the tree was given fruit. After seeing the fruit, he was very happy.
