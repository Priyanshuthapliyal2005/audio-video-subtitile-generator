1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In a very big tree in the field, it was very green.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was also covered with leaves.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One day, a child was going to that field.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It was also very hot.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He saw that there was a very big tree in front of it.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And there were leaves on that tree.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
After seeing the leaves, water came into his mouth.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He thought that he should rest a little after his stomach.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He slept for a while in the shade of the tree.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
After a while, he woke up and left.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The next day, he was standing there and laughing.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He saw that tree.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He said that there is not a single tree in the tree.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He asked, where did all the leaves go?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The tree said that all the leaves were eaten.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But if you give him water, then I will give you a lot of leaves.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That tree was given water every day.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After a few days, the tree was given fruit.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
After seeing the fruit, he was very happy.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We get this story so easily.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That we should give water to the tree plants.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In return, we give good weather, fruit and vegetables to the tree.
