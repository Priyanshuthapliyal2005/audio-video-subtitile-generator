00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
There was a great teacher in a village.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
He was a farmer.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
One day, he was invited to a press conference.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
He was told that he would reach more than 10,000 people.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
He was invited to a press conference.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
When he came to the press conference,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
there was no one there.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Only this teacher was there.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
The teacher who had made a lot of conversation with him,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
had a big change.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
He thought about what to do.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
He asked the farmer.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
After that,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
He said,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
When he went to the field,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
he went out of the field.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Even if there was only one field,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I would come out with the field that I needed.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
He said so.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
This teacher was like a snake in his eye.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
He started his presentation by putting a sabaash.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
He presented a great presentation

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
by putting a sabaash.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
After that,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
He asked the farmer,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
How was my conversation?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
After that,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I was a farmer.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I didn't know anything.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
If there was only one farmer in the field,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I would come out with the field that I needed.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Even if there was only one farmer in the field,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I wouldn't come out with the field that I needed.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
He said so.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
The face of the teacher was lost.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
We have to say whatever they need,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
whatever they understand.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
If we are in a place where we don't need

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
to know anything,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
they will say,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We are the eggs.
