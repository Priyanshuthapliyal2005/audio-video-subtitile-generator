0	3000	There was a great teacher in a village.
3000	5000	He was a farmer.
5000	8000	One day, he was invited to a press conference.
8000	11000	He was told that he would reach more than 10,000 people.
11000	14000	He was invited to a press conference.
14000	17000	When he came to the press conference,
17000	20000	there was no one there.
20000	23000	Only this teacher was there.
23000	25000	The teacher who had made a lot of conversation with him,
25000	27000	had a big change.
27000	29000	He thought about what to do.
29000	31000	He asked the farmer.
31000	33000	After that,
33000	35000	He said,
35000	37000	When he went to the field,
37000	39000	he went out of the field.
39000	41000	Even if there was only one field,
41000	43000	I would come out with the field that I needed.
43000	45000	He said so.
45000	47000	This teacher was like a snake in his eye.
47000	51000	He started his presentation by putting a sabaash.
51000	55000	He presented a great presentation
55000	59000	by putting a sabaash.
59000	61000	After that,
61000	63000	He asked the farmer,
63000	65000	How was my conversation?
65000	67000	After that,
67000	69000	I was a farmer.
69000	71000	I didn't know anything.
71000	75000	If there was only one farmer in the field,
75000	78000	I would come out with the field that I needed.
78000	82000	Even if there was only one farmer in the field,
82000	84000	I wouldn't come out with the field that I needed.
84000	86000	He said so.
86000	90000	The face of the teacher was lost.
90000	94000	We have to say whatever they need,
94000	96000	whatever they understand.
96000	98000	If we are in a place where we don't need
98000	100000	to know anything,
100000	102000	they will say,
102000	104000	We are the eggs.
