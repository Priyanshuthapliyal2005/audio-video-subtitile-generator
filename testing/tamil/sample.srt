1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There was a great teacher in a village.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He was a farmer.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One day, he was invited to a press conference.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He was told that he would reach more than 10,000 people.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He was invited to a press conference.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
When he came to the press conference,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
there was no one there.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Only this teacher was there.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The teacher who had made a lot of conversation with him,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
had a big change.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He thought about what to do.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He asked the farmer.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
After that,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He said,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When he went to the field,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
he went out of the field.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even if there was only one field,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would come out with the field that I needed.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He said so.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This teacher was like a snake in his eye.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He started his presentation by putting a sabaash.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He presented a great presentation

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
by putting a sabaash.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After that,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He asked the farmer,

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How was my conversation?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
After that,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I was a farmer.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I didn't know anything.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If there was only one farmer in the field,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I would come out with the field that I needed.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if there was only one farmer in the field,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I wouldn't come out with the field that I needed.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He said so.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The face of the teacher was lost.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We have to say whatever they need,

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
whatever they understand.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If we are in a place where we don't need

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to know anything,

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
they will say,

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are the eggs.
